# And so on... But this is too much work! I didn't get into programming to work
# This is basically a substitution cipher - we have swapped letters for colours

# (Of course I know ahead of time that 1 colour = 1 letter, but that would always be my first guess anyway, and
# can be figured out pretty easily (just by swapping " " into the most common letter and looking at the result))

# Lets instead write a program to solve the cipher

# To do this, I would like to code up the algorithm described by Thomas Jakobsen in
# ‚ÄúA Fast Method for the Cryptanalysis of Substitution Ciphers‚Äù.
#
# https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266714630_A_fast_method_for_cryptanalysis_of_substitution_ciphers

# The algorithm goes like this:
# 1. Construct an initial guess of the key
# 2. Use this key to decrypt the message and calculate how much close the decrypted text is to english
#    Jacobsen uses a digram (two-letter) frequency table to do this.

# 3. Swap of the elements in the key
# 4. Again calculate how close the decrypted message is to english and if it's closer store the new key
# 5. Repeat from step 3 until the key hasn't changed for some number of cycles

# Jakobsen then does some smart stuff to speed it up, but let's just try this and see how it goes
