MY REABSORPTION INTO NORMAL LIFE WAS A PAINFUL AND DIFFICULT PROCESS. THE LOSS OF OVER FIVE YEARS CREATES MORE COMPLICATIONS THAN CAN BE IMAGINED, AND IN MY CASE THERE WERE COUNTLESS MATTERS TO BE ADJUSTED. WHAT I HEARD OF MY ACTIONS SINCE NINETEEN ZERO EIGHT ASTONISHED AND DISTURBED ME, BUT I TRIED TO VIEW THE MATTER AS PHILOSOPHICALLY AS I COULD. AT LAST REGAINING CUSTODY OF MY SECOND SON WINGATE, I SETTLED DOWN WITH HIM IN THE CRANE STREET HOUSE AND ENDEAVOURED TO RESUME TEACHINGMY OLD PROFESSORSHIP HAVING BEEN KINDLY OFFERED ME BY THE COLLEGE. I BEGAN WORK WITH THE FEBRUARY TERM, AND KEPT AT IT JUST A YEAR. BY THAT TIME I REALISED HOW BADLY MY EXPERIENCE HAD SHAKEN ME. THOUGH PERFECTLY SANEI HOPEDAND WITH NO FLAW IN MY ORIGINAL PERSONALITY, I HAD NOT THE NERVOUS ENERGY OF THE OLD DAYS. VAGUE DREAMS AND QUEER IDEAS CONTINUALLY HAUNTED ME, AND WHEN THE OUTBREAK OF THE WORLD WAR TURNED MY MIND TO HISTORY I FOUND MYSELF THINKING OF PERIODS AND EVENTS IN THE ODDEST POSSIBLE FASHION. MY CONCEPTION OF TIMEMY ABILITY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN CONSECUTIVENESS AND SIMULTANEOUSNESSSEEMED SUBTLY DISORDERED SO THAT I FORMED CHIMERICAL NOTIONS ABOUT LIVING IN ONE AGE AND CASTING ONES MIND ALL OVER ETERNITY FOR KNOWLEDGE OF PAST AND FUTURE AGES. THE WAR GAVE ME STRANGE IMPRESSIONS OF REMEMBERING SOME OF ITS FAROFF CONSEQUENCESAS IF I KNEW HOW IT WAS COMING OUT AND COULD LOOK BACK UPON IT IN THE LIGHT OF FUTURE INFORMATION. ALL SUCH QUASIMEMORIES WERE ATTENDED WITH MUCH PAIN, AND WITH A FEELING THAT SOME ARTIFICIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL BARRIER WAS SET AGAINST THEM. WHEN I DIFFIDENTLY HINTED TO OTHERS ABOUT MY IMPRESSIONS I MET WITH VARIED RESPONSES. SOME PERSONS LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLY AT ME, BUT MEN IN THE MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT SPOKE OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THOSE THEORIES OF RELATIVITYTHEN DISCUSSED ONLY IN LEARNED CIRCLESWHICH WERE LATER TO BECOME SO FAMOUS. DR. ALBERT EINSTEIN, THEY SAID, WAS RAPIDLY REDUCING TIME TO THE STATUS OF A MERE DIMENSION. BUT THE DREAMS AND DISTURBED FEELINGS GAINED ON ME, SO THAT I HAD TO DROP MY REGULAR WORK IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN. CERTAIN OF THE IMPRESSIONS WERE TAKING AN ANNOYING SHAPEGIVING ME THE PERSISTENT NOTION THAT MY AMNESIA HAD FORMED SOME UNHOLY SORT OF EXCHANGE THAT THE SECONDARY PERSONALITY HAD INDEED BEEN AN INTRUDING FORCE FROM UNKNOWN REGIONS, AND THAT MY OWN PERSONALITY HAD SUFFERED DISPLACEMENT. THUS I WAS DRIVEN TO VAGUE AND FRIGHTFUL SPECULATIONS CONCERNING THE WHEREABOUTS OF MY TRUE SELF DURING THE YEARS THAT ANOTHER HAD HELD MY BODY. THE CURIOUS KNOWLEDGE AND STRANGE CONDUCT OF MY BODYS LATE TENANT TROUBLED ME MORE AND MORE AS I LEARNED FURTHER DETAILS FROM PERSONS, PAPERS, AND MAGAZINES. QUEERNESSES THAT HAD BAFFLED OTHERS SEEMED TO HARMONISE TERRIBLY WITH SOME BACKGROUND OF BLACK KNOWLEDGE WHICH FESTERED IN THE CHASMS OF MY SUBCONSCIOUS. I BEGAN TO SEARCH FEVERISHLY FOR EVERY SCRAP OF INFORMATION BEARING ON THE STUDIES AND TRAVELS OF THAT OTHER ONE DURING THE DARK YEARS. NOT ALL OF MY TROUBLES WERE AS SEMIABSTRACT AS THIS. THERE WERE THE DREAMSAND THESE SEEMED TO GROW IN VIVIDNESS AND CONCRETENESS. KNOWING HOW MOST WOULD REGARD THEM, I SELDOM MENTIONED THEM TO ANYONE BUT MY SON OR CERTAIN TRUSTED PSYCHOLOGISTS, BUT EVENTUALLY I COMMENCED A SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF OTHER CASES IN ORDER TO SEE HOW TYPICAL OR NONTYPICAL SUCH VISIONS MIGHT BE AMONG AMNESIA VICTIMS. MY RESULTS, AIDED BY PSYCHOLOGISTS, HISTORIANS, ANTHROPOLOGISTS, AND MENTAL SPECIALISTS OF WIDE EXPERIENCE, AND BY A STUDY THAT INCLUDED ALL RECORDS OF SPLIT PERSONALITIES FROM THE DAYS OF DAEMONIACPOSSESSION LEGENDS TO THE MEDICALLY REALISTIC PRESENT, AT FIRST BOTHERED ME MORE THAN THEY CONSOLED ME. I SOON FOUND THAT MY DREAMS HAD INDEED NO COUNTERPART IN THE OVERWHELMING BULK OF TRUE AMNESIA CASES. THERE REMAINED, HOWEVER, A TINY RESIDUE OF ACCOUNTS WHICH FOR YEARS BAFFLED AND SHOCKED ME WITH THEIR PARALLELISM TO MY OWN EXPERIENCE. SOME OF THEM WERE BITS OF ANCIENT FOLKLORE OTHERS WERE CASEHISTORIES IN THE ANNALS OF MEDICINE ONE OR TWO WERE ANECDOTES OBSCURELY BURIED IN STANDARD HISTORIES. IT THUS APPEARED THAT, WHILE MY SPECIAL KIND OF AFFLICTION WAS PRODIGIOUSLY RARE, INSTANCES OF IT HAD OCCURRED AT LONG INTERVALS EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF MANS ANNALS. SOME CENTURIES MIGHT CONTAIN ONE, TWO, OR THREE CASES OTHERS NONEOR AT LEAST NONE WHOSE RECORD SURVIVED. THE ESSENCE WAS ALWAYS THE SAMEA PERSON OF KEEN THOUGHTFULNESS SEIZED WITH A STRANGE SECONDARY LIFE AND LEADING FOR A GREATER OR LESSER PERIOD AN UTTERLY ALIEN EXISTENCE TYPIFIED AT FIRST BY VOCAL AND BODILY AWKWARDNESS, AND LATER BY A WHOLESALE ACQUISITION OF SCIENTIFIC, HISTORIC, ARTISTIC, AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AN ACQUISITION CARRIED ON WITH FEVERISH ZEST AND WITH A WHOLLY ABNORMAL ABSORPTIVE POWER. THEN A SUDDEN RETURN OF THE RIGHTFUL CONSCIOUSNESS, INTERMITTENTLY PLAGUED EVER AFTER WITH VAGUE UNPLACEABLE DREAMS SUGGESTING FRAGMENTS OF SOME HIDEOUS MEMORY ELABORATELY BLOTTED OUT. AND THE CLOSE RESEMBLANCE OF THOSE NIGHTMARES TO MY OWNEVEN IN SOME OF THE SMALLEST PARTICULARSLEFT NO DOUBT IN MY MIND OF THEIR SIGNIFICANTLY TYPICAL NATURE. ONE OR TWO OF THE CASES HAD AN ADDED RING OF FAINT, BLASPHEMOUS FAMILIARITY, AS IF I HAD HEARD OF THEM BEFORE THROUGH SOME COSMIC CHANNEL TOO MORBID AND FRIGHTFUL TO CONTEMPLATE. IN THREE INSTANCES THERE WAS SPECIFIC MENTION OF SUCH AN UNKNOWN MACHINE AS HAD BEEN IN MY HOUSE BEFORE THE SECOND CHANGE.
